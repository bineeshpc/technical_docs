Computer science
================

Computer science is the study of computation: that is, how to represent
and process information. Here are just a few of the concepts you might
study:

Problem solving
---------------

you'll learn algorithms - that is, general strategies, such as divide
and conquer, recursion, heuristics, greedy search, and randomized
algorithms - that help you model, decompose, and solve any kind of
problem.

Logic
-----

you will start to use precise and formal methods of thinking, including
abstraction, boolean logic, number theory, and set theory, so you can
solve problems in an air tight manner.

Data
----

you will touch information theory and start asking questions like what
is information? How do you represent it? How do you model the real
world?

Systems
-------

how do you design and build complex systems that satisfy a set of
requirements and constraints? Systems engineering is an essential topic
in almost every business.

Thinking
--------

one of the best ways to understand the human mind is to try to replicate
it. Topics like artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer
vision, and natural language processing are at the forefront of not only
computer science, but also biology, psychology, philosophy, and
mathematics.
