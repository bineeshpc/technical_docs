"""

In an American football game, a play can lead to 2 points (safety), 3 points (field goal),
or 7 points (touchdown, assuming the extra point). Many different combinations of
2, 3, and 7 point plays can make up a final score. For example, four combinations of
plays yield a score of 12:
 6 safeties (2x6 = 12),
 3 safeties and 2 field goals (2x3 + 3x2 = 12),
 1 safety, 1 field goal and 1 touchdown (2xl + 3xl + 7xl = 12), and
 4 field goals (3x4 = 12).
