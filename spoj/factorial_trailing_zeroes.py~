def num_trailing_zeroes_in_factorial(n):
    """ There will be trailing zeroes in n! if and
    only if the numbers involved in it are multiples of 5
    and 2.
    Examples: 5! will have 1 zero because or numbers 5 and 2
    10! will have 2 zeroes because 5, 2, 5, 2. First 5 and 2 were 
    contributed by number 10
    We need to find out the number of times n! is divisible by 5 and 
    number of times n! is divisible by 2
    Let us say that n! is divisible by 5, a times
    and n! is divisible by 2, b times
    Then we take the minimum of a and b
    and that will be the answer
    Take the case of 15!
    5 * 5 * 5, 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
    5 = 3 times
    2 = 7 times
    minimum(3, 7)= 3
    This will have 3 zeroes

    Let us test our theory by writing a simple algorithm for 15!
    Theory seems to be correct!!
